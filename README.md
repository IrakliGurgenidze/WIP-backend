# WIP-backend
Backend repo for "Work in Progress"

8/1/2025

Work so far:
- Established basic project skeleton and directory structure
- Set up development environment with TypeScript and Node.js
- Integrated Prisma ORM for structured, type-safe db queries
- Prepared for future API and service layer development

Issues:
- Backend is underdeveloped, spent a lot of time researching similar projects, organizing local environment, and laying out basics of frontend. 
- Need to begin building out API tools and DB integrations.
